## Description

It displays the current date and time at the top of the page and the time blocks are color coded meaning the past is grey, present is red, and future is green. To work the calendar you click on the text area of what time you would like to add your task and you can enter text. You will then click the save button once you want to save that task to your calendar. That task will save onto the calendar even when you refresh the page.
